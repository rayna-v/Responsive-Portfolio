        <!-- INTRODUCTION -->

        <p>
        <P ALIGN=Center><strong>TOOL</strong> is often referred to as a <em>Progressive Metal</em> band though most
            would agree they are in a class of their own. <br>
            I, unfortunately, had not been introduced to <B>TOOL</B> until 2007. My, now husband, was a big fan and gave
            me the <em>&#198enima</em> to listen to.<br>
            Never had I ever <em>experienced</em> music before playing that album on repeat. The more I heard it, the
            most I could feel it. It didn't take long <br>
            before I was hungry to hear more, and the entirety of their catalogue did not disappoint. In fact, the more
            I took in, the deeper my appreciation <br>
            became. <B>TOOL</B> is my <br>

        <br>

        <!-- MJK - bio/info -->

        <p>Maynard is the most widely known member of <B>TOOL</B> largely due to his success with the band <em>A Perfect
                Circle</em>. He happens to be my <br>
            favorite rock singer of all time. His voice is so versatile that it almost sounds like someone different
            from song to song. Though <br>
            many fans may consider <B>TOOL</B> to be a <em>metal</em> band, what I love most about Maynard is his robust
            yell that isn't too throaty or deep <br>
            and always expertly used to create a purposeful and powerful effect.<br>
            <br>
            Maynard keeps himself busy between his three main bands: <B>TOOL</B>, <em>A Perfect Circle</em>, and, the
            less widely known, <em>Puscifer</em>, but <br>
            he is also an entrepreneur who has a vineyard and winery, <em>Caduceus Cellars</em>, in addition to other
            businesses including <em>Merkin Vineyards <br>
                Osteria</em>, a bar/restaurant in Cottonwood, AZ; a food truck, <em>Merkin Vineyards Wagon</em>, and a
            merch store, <em>The Puscifer Store</em>, in <br>
            Jerome, AZ.<br>

        <p>Adam Jones is a Grammy Award-winning guitarist who, along with Maynard and Danny Carey, has been with Tool
            since its conception in 1990. He is not known <br>
            necessarily for his technical ability but his unique tone and tendency to combine different techniques which
            adds to the overal texture of the musical experience. <br>
            <br>
            It seems that his aggressive tone can be attributed to his main guitar (a <em>1979 Les Paul Custom
                Silverburst</em> which he has several models of and has <br>
            played since <B>TOOL's</B> beginning) as well as his choice of amplifiers. In late June of 2020, <B>TOOL</B>
            announced that Gibson Guitars is going to release a<br>
            a signature model of his guitar to emulate the look and sound. He has used a Marshall Superbass as his
            primary amplifier adding a Diesel VH4 since Aenima and a <br>
            Rivera Knucklehead Tre on the latest album <em>Fear Inoculum</em>.<br>
            <br>
            Though Adam's primary focus has always been with <B>TOOL</B>, he has also toured with and contributed to
            <em>The Melvins</em> which is known to have greatly <br>
            influenced <B>TOOL's</B> sound and style. In addition to music, he is also a gifted artist. through work
            such as album art, film, Hollywood makeup and set design, <br>
            photography, and comics. He is also known to be kind to fans and seems to have a great sense of humor; for
            Halloween 2019, he played a show as Dwight from The Office<br>
            which I think also highlights his aesthethic artistic ability.</p>
