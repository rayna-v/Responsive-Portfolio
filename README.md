Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

## Acceptance Criteria:

Without the use of media queries, I have created a mobile responsive portfolio using Bootstrap's grid system 
while doing the following:

    * I used an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.

    * The deployed application is functional and all of the links are working (with the exception of intentionally 
    empty links  labeled 'coming soon').

    * I used semantic HTML tags whenever possible.
    
    * All pages have a working and responsive Navbar that is consistent.
    
    * Content is personalized.

    * Sticky footer works on all pages.

    * I used sub-rows and columns on my portfolio site.

    * I made multiple, descriptive commits throughout my work.

### Deployment:
